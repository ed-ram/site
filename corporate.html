<!-- Page 2 (corporate events)

All of our corporate events are bespoke to ensure that you get the outcomes from the day that your team needs. We ensure that our events are fun, friendly and most of all informal to ensure that everybody is relaxed and that it's a a real retreat from the office. We offer anything from bake off competitions, bread making, handmade filled chocolates to cake decorating, to suit individual and group approaches.

Due to the bespoke nature of our corporate events please email us to discuss your needs.

Page 3 (parties)

We know how important it is to have lasting memories of parties and that is why we ensure that you have fun but that all of your guests have skills and stories to take away. Whether that be a hen party, a family get together, baby shower, children's celebration or a significant birthday. We bespoke your day to suit dietary needs, location, and ensure we fit to your planned programme.
