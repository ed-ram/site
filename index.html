      <!-- <h2>About Us</h2> -->
      <p>We are a cookery school that aims to bring new and fresh ideas into your everyday cooking and at a skill level that suits you. We run a range of inspirational classes from chocolate making, to advanced french patisserie skills. Where we are different is that we come to you. Our experience has found that every kitchen is different from the oven, to the functional space and it's day to day use so we ensure our courses are tailored to you and your kitchen.</p>

      <p>The school is run by Katie Churchard who is a highly experienced pastry chef and who specialises in chocolate work. Professionally she has worked in 5* London Hotels and a number of Michelin star restaurants, which have included working for Raymond Blanc and Gordon Ramsey.</p>

      <p>If you are looking for a gift we offer gift vouchers that can be used for bespoke sessions or one of our classes. If you are after private parties, hen parties or children parties we offer a range of options to suit your needs and can bespoke our offering for all dietary requirements.</p>

      <p>For those planning corporate parties we find cooking together is a fantastic and innovative way for team building especially as most of our clients like to culminate their day in eating what they have made with a well deserved glass of wine.</p>
